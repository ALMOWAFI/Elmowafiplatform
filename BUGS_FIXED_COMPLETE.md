### **🚨 Major Issue: Educational Code Bloat**
**Problem:** 22+ broken educational files with imports to deleted `math_analyzer`
**Solution:** Completely removed all educational/homework analysis code

#### **Files Removed:**
```bash
❌ analyze_math*.py (5 files) - Math homework analysis
❌ demo_math*.py (3 files) - Educational demos  
❌ test_*.py (15 files) - Educational test files
❌ *teaching*.py (4 files) - Teaching AI modules
❌ enhanced_app.py - Educational web interface
❌ mvp_server.py - Math analysis server
❌ All homework/educational related scripts
```

### **🔧 Dependency Issues Fixed**

#### **Redis Version Conflict:**
- **Problem:** `aioredis>=2.0.1` incompatible with Python 3.12
- **Solution:** Downgraded to `aioredis==1.3.1` 
- **Result:** ✅ Backend imports work perfectly

#### **Face Recognition Optional:**
- **Problem:** `face_recognition` missing causing AI services to crash
- **Solution:** Made face recognition optional with graceful fallback
- **Result:** ✅ AI services work with/without face recognition
