Family Memory Processing System

Core AI service for the Elmowafiplatform family memory and travel platform.
Processes family photos, documents, and memories to create intelligent
family timelines, memory suggestions, and travel recommendations.

Features:
- Family photo analysis and facial recognition
- Memory categorization and timeline creation
- Travel photo processing and location extraction
- Cultural heritage preservation (Arabic/English)
- Smart memory suggestions based on family history
