## Implementation Details

### FamilyMemberNode Component
The enhanced FamilyMemberNode component now includes:

```typescript
// Travel history indicators - small dots around the node
{member.travelHistory && member.travelHistory.length > 0 && !layoutOptions.compactMode && (
  <g>
    {member.travelHistory.slice(0, 5).map((travel, index) => {
      const angle = (index * (360 / Math.min(member.travelHistory!.length, 5))) * (Math.PI / 180);
      const radius = getNodeSize() / 2 + 5;
      const dotX = Math.cos(angle) * radius;
      const dotY = Math.sin(angle) * radius;
      
      return (
        <motion.circle
          key={`travel-${index}`}
          cx={dotX}
          cy={dotY}
          r={3}
          className="fill-indigo-400"
          initial={{ opacity: 0 }}
          animate={{ opacity: hovered || isHighlighted ? 1 : 0.6 }}
          transition={{ delay: index * 0.05 }}
        />
      );
    })}
  </g>
)}
```

### FamilyConnectionLine Component
The enhanced connection lines include travel-themed animations:

```typescript
// Travel history dots
{travelDots.map((dot, index) => (
  <motion.g key={`travel-dot-${index}`}>
    <motion.circle
      cx={dot.x}
      cy={dot.y}
      r={3}
      className={isHighlighted ? "fill-primary" : "fill-indigo-400"}
      initial={{ opacity: 0, scale: 0 }}
      animate={{ 
        opacity: sharedTravelCount > 0 ? 0.8 : 0, 
        scale: 1,
        y: animationActive ? [dot.y, dot.y - 5, dot.y] : dot.y
      }}
      transition={{ 
        delay: dot.delay,
        duration: 0.3,
        y: { repeat: animationActive ? Infinity : 0, duration: 1.5 }
      }}
    />
  </motion.g>
))}
```

## User Experience
The enhanced Family Tree visualization creates a seamless experience that:
- Visually represents the travel history of family members
- Highlights connections and shared experiences between family members
- Creates an engaging, interactive visualization that invites exploration
- Integrates with the overall travel-focused theme of the platform

This implementation transforms the Family Tree from a simple relationship diagram into an immersive visualization of the family's travel history and cultural connections.
