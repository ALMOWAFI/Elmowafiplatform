# ðŸš€ WEEK 1 IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN
## Post-Launch Optimization & Production Polish

*Start Date: Current*  
*Duration: 7 Days*  
*Priority: CRITICAL - Production Stability*

---

## ðŸ“Š CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS

### **Build Analysis Results**
- **Main Bundle**: `index-BbBHMfwg.js` = **1,879 KB** (545 KB gzipped)
- **CSS Bundle**: `index-WAcfp-6t.css` = **96 KB** (16 KB gzipped)
- **Warning**: Bundle size exceeds recommended 500KB limit

### **Immediate Issues Identified**
1. **Large Bundle Size**: 1.88MB is too large for optimal loading
2. **No Code Splitting**: Everything loads at once
3. **Heavy Dependencies**: Three.js and other libraries bundled together
4. **No Caching Strategy**: No service worker or aggressive caching
5. **No Error Monitoring**: Production errors not tracked
