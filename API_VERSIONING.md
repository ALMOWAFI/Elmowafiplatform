# API Versioning Strategy for Elmowafiplatform

## Overview

This document outlines the API versioning strategy for the Elmowafiplatform. The goal is to provide a consistent and reliable API experience for clients while allowing the platform to evolve and improve over time.

## Versioning Scheme

The Elmowafiplatform uses a URI path versioning scheme. All API endpoints are prefixed with `/api/v{version_number}` where `{version_number}` is the major version of the API.

Example:
```
/api/v1/users
/api/v1/memories
/api/v2/users
```

## Version Lifecycle

Each API version goes through the following lifecycle stages:

1. **Development**: The API version is under active development and may change without notice.
2. **Beta**: The API version is feature complete but may still have bugs or performance issues.
3. **Stable**: The API version is production-ready and follows semantic versioning for changes.
4. **Deprecated**: The API version is scheduled for removal. Clients should migrate to a newer version.
5. **Sunset**: The API version is no longer available.

## Compatibility Policy

### Breaking Changes

Breaking changes include:
- Removing or renaming fields, endpoints, or parameters
- Changing field types or validation rules
- Changing the behavior of existing endpoints

Breaking changes will only be introduced in new major versions of the API.

### Non-Breaking Changes

Non-breaking changes include:
- Adding new fields, endpoints, or parameters
- Adding new optional request parameters
- Adding new response fields
- Fixing bugs that don't change the expected behavior

Non-breaking changes may be introduced in the current API version.

## Version Support

The Elmowafiplatform will support at least two major API versions at any given time. When a new major version is released, the oldest supported version will be deprecated.

Deprecated versions will continue to be available for at least 6 months after deprecation to allow clients time to migrate to newer versions.

## Version Headers

In addition to the URI path versioning, clients can specify the desired API version using the `Accept` header:

```
Accept: application/json; version=1
```

If the `Accept` header specifies a version that conflicts with the URI path version, the URI path version takes precedence.

## GraphQL API

The GraphQL API is available at `/api/v1/graphql` and follows a different versioning strategy. The GraphQL schema evolves over time, but maintains backward compatibility through deprecation annotations.

Deprecated fields and types will be marked with `@deprecated` directives in the schema, along with a description of what to use instead.

## Documentation

API documentation is available for each version at `/api/v{version_number}/docs`.

The documentation includes:
- Available endpoints and their parameters
- Request and response formats
- Authentication requirements
- Rate limiting information
- Examples of common use cases

## Migration Guides

When a new API version is released, migration guides will be provided to help clients upgrade from the previous version. These guides will include:

- A summary of changes between versions
- Code examples for common migration scenarios
- Recommendations for testing and deployment

## Changelog

### v1 (Current)

- Initial release of the Elmowafiplatform API
- Support for user management, memories, budgets, and travel recommendations
- REST and GraphQL interfaces

### v2 (Planned)

- Enhanced authentication with OAuth 2.0
- Improved error handling and validation
- New endpoints for cultural heritage and family connections
- Performance optimizations for large datasets

## Best Practices for API Clients

1. **Version Specification**: Always specify the API version in requests to ensure consistent behavior.
2. **Feature Detection**: Check for the presence of fields or endpoints rather than assuming they exist.
3. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to gracefully handle unexpected responses.
4. **Monitoring**: Monitor API deprecation notices and plan migrations accordingly.
5. **Testing**: Test applications against both current and upcoming API versions to ensure compatibility.
