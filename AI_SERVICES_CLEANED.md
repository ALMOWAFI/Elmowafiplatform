# üßπ AI SERVICES CLEANED - Educational Bloat Removed

**Date:** 2025-07-25  
**Action:** Removed irrelevant educational/homework analysis features

## ‚ùå **REMOVED (Educational Bloat):**

### **What Was Removed:**
- **`math_analyzer/` directory** - Homework grading and math problem analysis (1.7MB)
- **Teaching styles system** - Academic feedback and educational AI personas
- **Math error detection** - School assignment analysis tools
- **Educational templates** - Homework interfaces and school-focused UI

### **Why It Was Removed:**
- **Irrelevant to family platform** - Your platform is for family memories and travel, not homework
- **Feature creep** - Educational AI doesn't belong in a family photo/travel platform
- **Complexity bloat** - Unnecessary academic features cluttering the codebase
